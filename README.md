# Railspeeder Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Railspeeder** project, hosted using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) Jekyll theme.

Railspeeder is a UCSC Slugbotics and Baskin Engineering project to design a lightweight, all-electric vehicle capable of traveling along abandoned rail lines in Santa Cruz. This platform will be used for rail inspection, environmental surveying, and analysis to support future revitalization efforts.
