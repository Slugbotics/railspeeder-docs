# Railspeeder Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Railspeeder** project, hosted
using the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) Jekyll theme.

Railspeeder is a UCSC Slugbotics and Baskin Engineering project to design a
lightweight, all-electric vehicle capable of traveling along abandoned rail
lines in Santa Cruz. This platform will be used for rail inspection,
environmental surveying, and analysis to support future revitalization efforts.

Further documentation on the project and contributing can be found on the
