# Railspeeder Payload

This page documents the design, components, and function of the **[Payload]**
subsystem in the Railspeeder project.

---

## Overview

Payload is the mission hardware of Railspeeder. It is what gives us the ability
to perform detailed inspections of railways at high speed. Through this we can
give saftey reports and advise what rail lines are appropiate for public use,
thus expanding the American rail network and making public transportation more
expansive and affordable.

## Design Requirements

The payload is host to a suite of sensors and data processors enumerated below.

- Line scan camera
- Laser scanner
- Eddy current array
- Real time processing
- Data logging
