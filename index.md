# Railspeeder Project

> [!abstract]  
> A lightweight, all-electric vehicle designed to ride along abandoned rail lines in Santa Cruz for exploration, infrastructure analysis, and restoration planning.

Welcome to the **Railspeeder** project, a student project led by UCSC Slugbotics and Baskin Engineering. Our  mission is to design and build a lightweight electric vehicle capable of traveling along abandoned and decommissioned rail corridors in the greater Santa Cruz area.

This vehicle will serve as a mobile platform for collecting data to assess the condition of these historic rail lines. Key goals include enabling sustainable exploration, identifying restoration needs, and supporting future rail revitalization projectsâ€”all with minimal environmental impact.
