# Railspeeder Project

### A lightweight, all-electric vehicle designed to ride along abandoned rail lines in Santa Cruz for exploration, infrastructure analysis, and restoration planning.

Welcome to the **Railspeeder** project, a student project led by UCSC Slugbotics
and Baskin Engineering. Our mission is to design and build a lightweight
electric vehicle capable of traveling along abandoned and decommissioned rail
corridors in the greater Santa Cruz area.

This vehicle will serve as a mobile platform for collecting data to assess the
condition of these historic rail lines. Key goals include enabling sustainable
exploration, identifying restoration needs, and supporting future rail
revitalization projectsâ€”all with minimal environmental impact.
